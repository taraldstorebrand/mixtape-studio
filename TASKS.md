### Task 1: Improve styling for selected song item

**Goal:** Reduce visual harshness of the selected song item in the history list and add a subtle background tint while keeping functionality unchanged.

**Files:**

- `frontend/src/components/history/HistoryItem/HistoryItem.module.css` - Update `.selected` class styling

**Details:**

- Reduce border contrast/opacity of the blue border slightly to make it less harsh
- Add a very subtle background tint for selected items
- Avoid strong glow effects or overly bright styling
- Do NOT change layout, structure, or interaction logic
- Only update CSS color and opacity values for selected state
- Maintain clear visual distinction that item is selected
- Use existing CSS variables from `frontend/src/styles/variables.css`

---

## Constraints

- Follow AGENTS.md style rules
- No new dependencies
- Minimal changes to existing architecture
- Do NOT change layout, structure, or click behavior
- Only adjust colors and opacity for selected state
- Always use CSS variables from `frontend/src/styles/variables.css`
